comparison:
if [ -z "$RESULTS" ]
then
	stuff
else
	other stuff
fi

-z $S checks if $S is null
-n $S checks if $S is not null

loop:
for f in $FILES
do
	stuff
done

concat strings:
S1+=$S2

arrays:
DAYS=( sun mon tue wed thu fri sat ), zero based indexing
${DAYS[some number]}. The contents may not be contiguous. So 0,1,2,... works,
as does 0,300,43,62
