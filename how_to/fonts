X looks for fonts in a given path only. It doesn't search recursively.
List all fonts:
fc-list

By default, fonts are searched for in /usr/share/fonts and 
~/.local/share/fonts. To add a new font, place it in one of these paths
(preferably the latter) and run fc-cache.

Run fc-query /path/to/font.ext to see the information of the font. There
are many pieces of data, but the ones to look for are family and foundry.
Fonts are described with 14 elements in the following format:

foundry-family-weight-slant-swidth-adstyle-pixlsz-ptSz-resx-rexy-spc-avgWdth-rgstry-encdng.

Actual values are substituted for each element. * denotes all values for a
particular element.

To display Japanese in xterm, write this line in ~/.Xresources:
    xterm*wideFont: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-ja-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
For non-moon languages, use 'font' instead of 'wideFont'.
