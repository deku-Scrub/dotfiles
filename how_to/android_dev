-Use fragments as much as possible, and make them as modular as possible.

-If a fragment doesn't fit in the current activity, then make a new activity
that holds the fragment in a FrameLayout.  Call this with an Intent.

-Pass initial values to fragments not with a constructor, but with a static
getInstance method.  Use setArguments to pass the values to the fragment.

-onCreate for fragments is for initializing data, not views.  Use getArguments
to get data passed via the static initializer.

-onCreateView for fragments is for initiazling the views.

-onAttach for fragments makes available the associated context (activity).
Check that it implements an interface here.

-Extend DialogFragment to show a custom dialog.
